# Background:
# There is a ton of friction when uploading SMS contacts into Klaviyo.
# This is one of our clients' first onboarding steps with SMS.
# The process can be extremely frustrating when phone #s arenâ€™t successfully imported due to improper formatting.

# Solution:
# (1) Programmatically reformat phone #s in E.164 format.
# (2) Capture country & language as additional properties.
# (3) Upload SMS consent.

# Future considerations:
# (1) Consider this functionality be moved into the actual UI when uploading a CSV file of SMS contacts.
# (2) Consider iterating over each possible country that we service to pull out all viable phone numbers in a single csv.
